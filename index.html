                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I’m Natalie. I’m a Sacramento-based writer who loves reading, writing, and helping others tell their stories. </p>
                <p>Having developed a love for writing early on in my education, I decided to pursue a BA in Professional Writing at Baylor University, where I also had the opportunity to write for several local nonprofits. My favorite thing about writing is that in the course of a writing project, I get to learn about something new and interesting—whether that be a new technology, community, program, or person— and share this new interest with others.</p>
                <p>After also developing a love for research during my undergraduate years, I decided to pursue academia and get an MA in English at Oregon State University. Here, while I enjoyed researching, I missed the practical work of writing newsletters, articles, and blogs, knowing that my writing was immediately helpful to somebody. Now a new resident of Sacramento, I am excited to continue telling stories, sharing ideas, and learning new things through my writing. If you want to learn more about me and my experience, you can <a href="http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/67e0c2_b25ce25280474f44882191ef73b2b00a.pdf" target="_blank">read my resume here.</a></p>

                <p>I am passionate about telling stories, whether that be through a grant proposal, newsletter, or flyer. I have varied writing experiences, working with nonprofits, universities, and city government. The following are a few samples of my work.</p>

                      <p>While interning at The Arts Center, an art gallery in Corvallis, Oregon, I wrote a series of eight blog posts about the intersection of science and art. The purpose of this series was to promote an upcoming show, “To See the Unseen,” which focused on representing microbiology through artwork. This blog post, titled “Made of Clay,” is about a contributing ceramics artist. </p>

                    <p>During my internship with Act Locally Waco, another intern and I co-wrote a weekly newsletter which highlighted all of the events and opportunities in the Waco community.

                    <p>As a web content assistant at Baylor University Graduate School, I wrote thirteen stories for Baylor's web page, Grad Focus. Each story is about an excellent student or program in the Graduate School. This story is about Baylor University’s Clinic for Assessment, Research, and Education, a program that provides assessments and therapy for children with disabilities</p>

                    <p>I co-wrote this grant proposal with three of my classmates in a Writing for the Workplace class. Our assignment was to identify a need on Baylor University's campus and write a grant proposal for a solution to that need. Our grant proposes a series of financial literacy seminars open to all Baylor students.  I wrote the introduction, executive summary, and current situation sections. In addition, I designed the grant layout, and edited each section.</p>

                    <p>During the summer of 2013, I had the opportunity to travel to England with a group of classmates and professors as a part of the Baylor in Oxford program. While in England, I chronicled my adventures in this travel blog. The specific post I have included here is about a hike through the countryside near Oxford. Here I briefly analyze the intriguing lifestyle of people who live on houseboats in the canals near Oxford.</p>

                    <p>At Oregon State University, I interned with the Writing Intensive Curriculum (WIC), which publishes a quarterly newsletter focused on writing pedagogy. The WIC newsletter is sent to professors and instructors across the university. I contributed this Q&A article to the newsletter, based on an interview I conducted with Dr. Sally Hacker, a community ecologist and professor in Oregon State’s Department of Integrative Biology.</p>

After the course ended, I submitted the paper to Young Scholars in Writing, a peer-reviewed undergraduate journal, where it was accepted and published.</p>
